### 1.0.0

Thanks to a superhero effort from @eliperelman, we now have

+ `/devices`, `/devices/:id`, and `/device` instead of `/info`
+ Session support
+ Multiple connected device support
+ Remote adb host support

### 0.1.0

+ Add `GET /crashes` and `GET /crashes/:id` to service api.

### 0.0.1

+ Initial implementation for v0.0 API.
+ Only works with a single device at a time.
+ Does not work across platforms. For instance, you need unix `unzip`.
